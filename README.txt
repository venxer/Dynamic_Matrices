ORDER NOTATION:
For each of the functions below, write the order notation O().
Write each answer in terms of m = the number of rows and n = the
number of columns.  You should assume that calling new [] or delete []
on an array will take time proportional to the number of elements in
the array.

O(1)
get

O(1)
set

O(1)
num_rows

O(N)
get_column

O(N^2)
operator<<

O(N^2)
quarter

O(N^2)
operator==

O(N^2)
operator!=

O(1)
swap_rows

O(m^2 n)
rref (provided in matrix_main.cpp)



TESTING & DEBUGGING STRATEGY: 
Discuss your strategy for testing & debugging your program.  
What tools did you use (gdb/lldb/Visual Studio debugger,
Valgrind/Dr. Memory, std::cout & print, etc.)?  How did you test the
"corner cases" of your Matrix class design & implementation?
